                    <p>Hilversum is a city and municipality in the province of North Holland, Netherlands. Located in the heart of the Gooi region, it is the largest urban centre in that area. It is surrounded by heathland, woods, meadows, lakes, and smaller towns. Hilversum is part of the Randstad, one of the largest conurbations in Europe, and the Amsterdam metropolitan area; it is about 22 km southeast of Amsterdam's city centre and about 15 km north of Utrecht.
    
                        The city is home to the headquarters, studios, and broadcast stations of several major radio, television, and newspaper companies.</p>
                        
                        <p>The town is known for its architecturally important Town Hall (Raadhuis Hilversum), designed by Willem Marinus Dudok and built in 1931.
                        
                        Hilversum has one public library, two swimming pools (Van Hellemond Sport and De Lieberg), a number of sporting halls, and several shopping centers (such as Hilvertshof, Winkelcentrum Kerkelanden, De Riebeeckgalerij, and Winkelcentrum Seinhorst). Locally, the town center is known as het dorp, which means "the village".</p>

                    <p>Earthenware pottery discovered in Hilversum is associated with the Hilversum culture, which existed during the early to mid-Bronze Age, roughly from 1800 to 1200 BC. Objects from this ancient culture resemble items found in the Wessex Culture of southern Britain. This similarity suggests that the first people living in Hilversum might have moved there from the British area.</p>
    
                    <p>In the 19th century a substantial textile and tapestry industry emerged, aided by a railway link to Amsterdam in 1874. From that time the town grew quickly with rich commuters from Amsterdam moving in, building themselves large villas in the wooded surroundings, and gradually starting to live in Hilversum permanently. Despite this growth, Hilversum was never granted city rights so it is still referred to by many locals as "het dorp", or "the village."</p>

                   <p>For the 1928 Summer Olympics in neighbouring Amsterdam, Hilversum hosted all of the non-jumping equestrian and the running part of the modern pentathlon event.
    
                    Hilversum is often called the "Media City" of the Netherlands because it's the center of Dutch broadcasting. Many major Dutch radio and television broadcasters are headquartered here.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Media Park in Hilversum is where you can find many of the country's major TV and radio studios. It's like the Dutch equivalent of Hollywood. 
                    
                    The 1958 Eurovision Song Contest took place in Hilversum. In 2020 the international television event Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light was broadcast from Studio 21 in Hilversum's Media Park.
                    
                    Hilversum has its own airfield, Hilversum Airport, which is primarily used for recreational aviation.</p>
