                <p>Friend4friend is a project of the Maatschappelijke Diensttijd (MDT), aimed to connect young Dutch people and newcomers. After an intake interview you will be paired with a Dutch buddy with who you will be doing volunteer work in Hilversum. The volunteer work can be decided by the couple based on their interests. The project takes 6-8 months with group sessions every month. At the end of the project, you will receive a certificate, which can be useful for your portfolio.</p>
